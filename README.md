# Magic-Gamma-Telescope-classification
A machine learning project to classify the magic gamma telescope data into two categories - gamma(foreground) and background.

This project is aimed at using machine learning algorithms to classify the dataset which has a target class with two 
values g/h, the task is to classify the data into these two categories.

For this we will first split the dataset and use machine learning techniques like data preprocessing, data cleaning
and looking for missing values.

Then we will make a model and train it on the first part of the split data then after getting desired accurracy we will
use this model to predict the class for second part of out dataset.
